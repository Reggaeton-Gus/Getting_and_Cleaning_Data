# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data


Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Steps:

    Unzip the raw data

    Change current working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

    Put the run_analysis.R file in the previous folder.

    Run source("run_analysis.R")

    The datasets should get created in the current directory as merged_tidy_data.txt and merged_tidy_data_mean.txt

    Code book for the tidy dataset is available here.
